# Components
- TAP ACCESS PORT (TAP)
- TAP Controller
- Registers
- Instruction Decoder

## Registers
Registers are two types
- Instruction Register
- Data Register (Bypass Register, Boundary Scan Register, Device ID Register(optional), User Data Register(optional))

## TAP ACCESS PORT (TAP)
The JTAG interface called a TAP or Test Access Port uses different signals for supporting the boundary scan operation like TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO, and TRST.
TCK - Test clock
TMS - Test Mode Select
TDI - Test Data Input
TDO - Test Data Output
TRST - Test Reset

## TAP Controller
The TCK and TMS signals drive a finite state machine in the TAP controller. TMS is sampled on the rising edge of TCK and used to advance the state.

The actions taken in each state are as follows:

**Test-Logic-Reset**
In this state all test-modes (for example extest-mode) are reset, which will disable their operation, allowing the chip to follow its normal operation.

At start-up the external logic will drive TMS high for at least 5 TCK cycles. This guarantees to reach the Test-Logic-Reset state and remain there.

**Run-Test/Idle**
This is the resting state during normal operation.

**Select-DR-Scan , Select-IR-Scan**
These are the starting states respectively for accessing one of the data registers (the boundary-scan or bypass register in the minimal configuration) or the instruction register.

**Capture-DR , Capture-IR**
These capture the current value of one of the data registers or the instruction register respectively into the scan cells.

This is a slight misnomer for the instruction register, since it is usual to capture status information, rather than the actual instruction with Capture-IR.

**Shift-DR , Shift-IR**
Shift a bit in from TDI (on the rising edge of TCK) and out onto TDO (on the falling edge of TCK) from the currently selected data or instruction register respectively.

**Exit1-DR , Exit1-IR**
These are the exit states for the corresponding shift state. From here the state machine can either enter a pause state or enter the update state.

**Pause-DR , Pause-IR**
Pause in shifting data into the data or instruction register. This allows for example test equipment supplying TDO to reload buffers etc.

**Exit2-DR , Exit2-IR**
These are the exit states for the corresponding pause state. From here the state machine can either resume shifting or enter the update state.

**Update-DR , Update-IR**
The value shifted into the scan cells during the previous states is driven into the chip (from inputs) or onto the interconnect (for outputs).

So we have a simple state machine, which allows either data registers or the instruction register to go through its capture-shift-update cycle, with an option to pause during the shifting.
